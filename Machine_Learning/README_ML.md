# NailScan.ai - Detect Diabetes from Nail Conditions ðŸ¤–ðŸ’…

NailScan.ai leverages Machine Learning to detect diabetes through nail condition analysis. This repository contains the code and resources for building and deploying a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model trained on nail images to classify them as *Healthy* or *Diabetes*. Let's use technology to make healthcare more accessible and proactive! ðŸŒŸ
